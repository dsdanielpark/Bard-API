I welcome the overall code refactoring and new features. However, please make sure to conduct QA. Before making a PR, please check the entire functionality by adding it to https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/blob/main/func_test.ipynb. Due to various reasons, I couldn't implement test mocking code. I also welcome anyone who can provide test mocking and refactoring. But please keep the existing method names and examples. While I aim to accept PRs as quickly as possible, they may be rejected if QA is not correct.
